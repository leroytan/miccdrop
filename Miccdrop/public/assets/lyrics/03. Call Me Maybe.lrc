[00:04.48] I threw a wish in the well
[00:06.17] Don't ask me, I'll never tell
[00:08.14] I looked to you as it fell
[00:10.26] And now you're in my way
[00:12.25] I trade my soul for a wish
[00:14.14] Pennies and dimes for a kiss
[00:16.10] I wasn't looking for this
[00:18.06] But now you're in my way
[00:20.31] Your stare was holdin'
[00:21.87] Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
[00:23.83] Hot night, wind was blowin'
[00:25.88] Where you think you're goin', baby?
[00:28.31] Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
[00:32.64] But here's my number, so call me, maybe
[00:36.32] It's hard to look right at you, baby
[00:40.81] But here's my number, so call me, maybe
[00:44.26] Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
[00:48.66] But here's my number, so call me, maybe
[00:52.35] And all the other boys try to chase me
[00:56.51] But here's my number, so call me, maybe
[01:01.01] â™ª
[01:03.87] You took your time with the call
[01:06.12] I took no time with the fall
[01:08.29] You gave me nothing at all
[01:10.13] But still, you're in my way
[01:12.12] I beg and borrow and steal
[01:14.27] At first sight, and it's real
[01:16.19] I didn't know I would feel it
[01:18.10] But it's in my way
[01:20.11] Your stare was holdin'
[01:21.72] Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
[01:23.82] Hot night, wind was blowin'
[01:25.80] Where you think you're goin', baby?

[02:00.34] Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
[02:04.24] I missed you so bad, I missed you so, so bad
[02:08.51] Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
[02:12.25] And you should know that
