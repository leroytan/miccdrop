[00:07.74] You're insecure, don't know what for
[00:11.29] You're turning heads when you walk through the door
[00:15.24] Don't need makeup to cover up
[00:18.81] Being the way that you are is enough
[00:23.39] Everyone else in the room can see it
[00:27.25] Everyone else, but you, ooh
[00:30.52] Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
[00:34.23] The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
[00:38.04] But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
[00:42.18] You don't know, oh-oh
[00:44.74] You don't know you're beautiful
[00:46.98] If only you saw what I can see
[00:49.64] You'll understand why I want you so desperately
[00:53.44] Right now I'm lookin' at you, and I can't believe
[00:57.49] You don't know, oh-oh
[01:00.09] You don't know you're beautiful, oh, oh-oh

[01:12.71] To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
[01:16.53] I don't know why you're being shy
[01:20.56] And turn away when I look into your eyes
[01:24.85] Everyone else in the room can see it
[01:28.65] Everyone else, but you, ooh
[01:32.10] Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
