[00:06.23] Hello, it's me
[00:11.88] I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
[00:17.97] To go over everything
[00:23.45] They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
[00:30.49] Hello, can you hear me?
[00:36.03] I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
[00:42.07] When we were younger and free
[00:48.36] I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
[00:53.95] There's such a difference between us
[01:00.43] And a million miles
[01:07.25] Hello from the other side
[01:12.74] I must've called a thousand times
[01:18.41] To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
[01:24.06] But when I call, you never seem to be home
[01:31.47] Hello from the outside
[01:37.01] At least I can say that I've tried
[01:42.58] To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
[01:48.55] But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[02:01.51] Hello, how are you?
[02:07.13] It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
[02:13.62] I hope that you're well
[02:19.47] Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
[02:25.59] It's no secret that the both of us
[02:32.00] Are running out of time
